# Crowd-Sourced FAQ Generation System 
A beginner-friendly, mobile-responsive FAQ and query support system for the **Vicharanashala 
Internship**. 

## Project Goal 
The goal of this project is to help interns quickly find answers from existing FAQs, raise queries only 
when needed, discuss issues with peers/admins, and allow verified answers to become new FAQs. 
This project solves that by creating a simple support flow: 
1. Existing FAQs can be searched and browsed easily 
2. Interns are encouraged to find existing answers before raising new queries 
3. Interns can raise queries only when FAQs or similar discussions do not solve their issue 
4. Peers/admins can answer queries 
5. Admins can verify the best answer 
6. Verified answers can be converted into new FAQs 

**##Our Features**
➢ Low Cognitive Load 
➢ Duplicate Question Prevention 
➢ Beginner Intern Friendliness 
➢ Support Before Escalation 
➢ Attach Files for proof and more Visibility 
➢ Smart Search Facility 
➢ Categorical Distribution of FAQs for both Intern and Admins 
➢ Categorical Distribution of the State of Queries for admin 

## Current MVP Scope 

The MVP focuses on the most important product flow. 
1. FAQ Page 
2. Smart Search 
3. Raising Query Page 
4. Query Discussion Page 
5. Admin Verification Flow 
6. Labelled FAQs and Queries 
7. Badges on Query Status 
8. Convert Verified Answer into FAQ 

## Core Product Features 

### FAQ Page 
The FAQ page allow interns to: 
* View FAQs 
* Enable Smart Search of FAQs 
* Filter by Category 
* Open accordion answers 
* See FAQ source 
* See helpful count 
* Find answers quickly on mobile and desktop 

Search should support: 
* typo tolerance 
* fuzzy matching 
* synonyms 
* natural language style queries 

Example searches: 
money → stipend FAQ 
work from home → remote/offline FAQ 
how long → internship duration FAQ 
joining internship → VINS joining/acceptance FAQ 

### Raise Query Page 
The Raise Query page should allow interns to: 
* Enter a title 
* Describe their issue 
* Choose a category 
* Add tags 
* Attach file related to the problem 
* Submit a query 

Before submitting, the system should suggest: 
* matching FAQs 
* similar solved questions 
* related open discussions 
This prevents duplicate questions. 

### My Questions / Track Issue Page 
This page should show user’s: 
*  raised queries 
* status badges 
* timestamps 
* latest reply preview 
* resolved/verified status 

### Community Q&A 
This page should show: 
* Query details 
* Peer/admin replies 
* Verified answer badge (Work mode/General/..) 
* Reply form 
* Resolved status (Verified/Open/Answered/Resolved) 
* Allow peers to post a reply 

### Admin Verification Flow 
Admins can: 
* reply to queries 
* verify the best answer 
* resolve queries 
* convert verified replies into FAQs 

Interns cannot: 
* verify answers 
* convert replies into FAQs 
* perform admin moderation actions 

## MERN Full-Stack Setup 
This project uses the MERN stack: 
* MongoDB persistence through Mongoose 
* Express backend API 
* React frontend 
* Node.js runtime 
* Intern/admin registration and login 
* JWT bearer-token authentication 
* bcrypt password hashing 
* Authenticated `/api/auth/me` session restore 
* Backend role guards for admin-only APIs 
* Persistent queries, replies, FAQs, users, and helpful counts 
* Zod request validation and auth rate limiting 
* Production CORS configuration through `CORS_ORIGIN` 
* Frontend `VITE_API_BASE_URL` configuration 

Running `npm run seed` creates these default accounts: 
```txt 
admin@example.com / admin12345 
intern@example.com / intern12345 
``` 

Change `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SEED_INTERN_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, and 
`ADMIN_REGISTRATION_CODE` before deployment. 

### Local Full-Stack Run 

Prerequisite: 
```powershell 
Get-Service MongoDB 
``` 
The service should show `Running`. Configure `server/.env` using `server/.env.example`, then use 
two terminals. 

Terminal 1 — backend: 
```bash 
cd server 
npm run seed 
npm run dev 
``` 
Terminal 2 — frontend: 
```bash 
npm run dev 
``` 
Open: 
* Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` 
* Backend health: `http://localhost:3001/api/health` 
Seeded test accounts: 
```txt 
Intern: intern@example.com / intern12345 
Admin:  admin@example.com / admin12345 
``` 
### Deployment Notes 

Frontend: 
* Build command: `npm run build` 
* Output directory: `dist` 
* Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the deployed backend URL. 
Backend: 
* Build command: `npm run build` 
* Start command: `npm start` 
* Seed command: `npm run seed` 
* Set `MONGODB_URI`, `PORT`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `ADMIN_REGISTRATION_CODE`. 
* Use MongoDB Community Server locally or MongoDB Atlas for a managed database. 
Local MongoDB connection: 
```env 
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/cs19 
``` 
MongoDB Atlas connection shape: 
```env 
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-host>/cs19 
``` 
Tests: 
```bash 
npm test 
cd server 
npm test 
``` 
## Tech Stack

**##Backend Integration Status** 

The Express TypeScript backend is integrated with MongoDB through Mongoose. 

**What is connected:**

* Frontend service layer → backend REST APIs for auth, FAQs, queries, replies, and admin actions 
* Backend runs at `http://localhost:3001` 
* MongoDB persists users, FAQs, queries, replies, helpful counts, and query statuses 
* JWT authentication restores sessions and protects role-specific routes 
* Admin-only operations are enforced by backend role guards 
* `PATCH /api/faqs/:id/helpful` persists helpful-count increments 
* `PATCH /api/queries/:id/status` persists admin query-status changes 

## Backend API 
The frontend service layer calls the Express API. MongoDB persistence is isolated behind Mongoose 
repositories. 

Main endpoints: 
```txt 
POST  /api/auth/login 
POST  /api/auth/register 
GET   /api/auth/me 
GET   /api/faqs 
PATCH /api/faqs/:id/helpful 
GET   /api/queries 
GET   /api/queries/:id 
POST  /api/queries 
PATCH /api/queries/:id/status 
GET   /api/users/:userId/queries 
GET   /api/queries/:queryId/replies 
POST  /api/queries/:queryId/replies 
PATCH /api/admin/replies/:replyId/verify 
POST  /api/admin/replies/:replyId/convert-to-faq 
``` 
**Reply flow behavior:** 
* Both intern and admin roles use `GET/POST /api/queries/:queryId/replies` 
* The reply router receives the parent `queryId` through Express merged route parameters 
* Existing queries with zero replies return `{ success: true, data: [] }` 
* Missing parent queries return `404` 
* New replies are persisted in MongoDB and update the query reply preview 
* Admin replies move open queries to `answered` 
* The UI adds successful replies immediately and keeps typed text after failed submissions 

**FAQ source rules**: 
* `source: "existing"` — official/preloaded FAQs from seed data 
* `source: "crowd-sourced"` — FAQs created via Admin Convert-to-FAQ 

## Setup Instructions 
Install dependencies: 
```bash 
npm install 
``` 
Start development server: 
```bash 
npm run dev 
``` 
Create production build: 
```bash 
npm run build 
``` 
Preview production build: 
```bash 
npm run preview 
``` --- 
## Mobile Safety Requirements 
Every component must: 
* avoid horizontal overflow 
* support long text wrapping 
* support small widths 
* avoid fixed widths where possible 
* use responsive spacing 
* keep buttons usable on mobile 
* keep cards readable on mobile 

Useful Tailwind classes: 
```txt 
w-full 
max-w-full 
min-w-0 
break-words 
flex-wrap 
``` --- 
# FAQ Sources 
FAQs may originate from: 
1. Existing FAQ system 
2. Crowd-sourced verified replies 
Use a source field: 
```ts 
source: "existing" | "crowd-sourced"; 
``` 
# API Response Contract 
All service/API responses should follow a consistent structure: 
```ts 
type ApiResponse<T> = { 
success: boolean; 
data?: T; 
error?: string; 
}; 
``` 
This improves reliability and makes loading/error handling easier.

# Important Engineering Philosophy 
The goal is not: 
* maximum code generation 
* maximum features 
* maximum animations 
* building everything at once 
The goal is: 
* stable architecture 
* maintainable code 
* scalable structure 
* reliable user experience 
* strict TypeScript 
* mobile-safe UI 
* controlled prompts 
* disciplined branching 
* incremental development
